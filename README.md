# Model-Window

The Open Modal Window project is a simple, beginner-friendly webpage built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It demonstrates how to create interactive modal popups that open and close based on user actions.

- The webpage contains three buttons, each linked to a different modal window.

- When a user clicks on any button, a popup modal window appears on the UI displaying some relevant information.

- To close the modal, the user has three options: - Click close icon on the top right side of the modal window area. - Click outside the modal window area. - Press ESC key on the keyboard.

- The modals are styled using CSS for a clean and responsive design, while JavaScript handles the opening and closing logic, event listeners, and interactions.

This project is useful for understanding:

- DOM manipulation
- Event handling (click events, keyboard events)
- Dynamic UI behavior with modal windows

Itâ€™s a beginner-friendly project that demonstrates how to create interactive components commonly used in real-world websites and applications.
